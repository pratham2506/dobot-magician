A robotic arm that can be controlled using Arduino Mega microcontroller to perform pick and place tasks based on the objects colors. A Pixy camera is used to detect the objects in a plane and give the arm the co-ordinates of those objects. It also detects the color of the object and determines in which slot to place this object. Once the arm is callibrated along with the pixy cam, it performs it sortedly pick and place until all the objects are placed.
